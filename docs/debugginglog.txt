Test 1: Clear all rules using only
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```
Outcome: Worked normally

Test 1.5: Clear all rules using
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} { 
      allow read, write: if true;
      allow create: if true;
    }
  }
}
Out come: Issue persist

Test 2:
Change from match /users/{userId} { to match /{document=**} {
and delete both condition (from request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId) solve the issue.
But if not doing any one of them (removing only condition, or doesnt switch to document=**, it wont work)
(all other rules are not deleted)

conclusion: all other rules seems to be working fine, or is it? so its the system that has the problem?
